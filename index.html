<h1> Why did I Choose CSE? </h1>
<p> Every industry uses computers so naturally computer scientists can work in any. Problems in science, engineering, health care, and so many other areas can be solved by computers. It's up to the computer scientist to figure out how, and design the software to apply the solution. that's why i choose cse and i want to be a software engineer.</p>
